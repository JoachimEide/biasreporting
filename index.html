        <h2>Student Experiences</h2>
        <p>Earlier this year, Elon Senior Brianna Elder was scrolling through
          her Instagram feed when she came across a post that surprised her.
          The post, made by another Elon student, made fun of undocumented immigrants. </p>

        <p>She said the student, who Elder chose not to name, often posted
          captions that were “inappropriate,” but felt that one post in particular
          targeted several communities on Elon’s campus and needed to be addressed.</p>

        <p>“I felt that I was uncomfortable and it was kind of something that was
          like going around. Like my friends had all seen it and nobody was really
          taking action,” she said.</p>

        <p>This led her to fill out a bias report, a process at Elon and more
          than 200 other colleges and universities in the United States where
          anyone who experiences an act of bias can alert the appropriate administrators.</p>

        <p>The post she reported has since been taken down and the student’s
          account has been made private. </p>

        <p>After filing the report, Elder had several conversations with faculty
          members who made sure she was feeling okay, but she says she never
          received any follow up about the incident.</p>

        <p>Elder says she understands that specific details may not be public,
          but she “never really found out what became of it… that this was taken
          care of or that the student has been talked to at least.”</p>

        <p>Since filling out that initial report, Elder has experienced other
          acts of bias but ultimately decided not to file another report because
          she is unsure about the effectiveness of it. </p>

        <p>Senior Nic Zuhse is also no stranger to the bias report system,
          having filled out three during her time at Elon.</p>

        <p>All three incidents of bias took place in the classroom.
          The first was gender based. Zuhse felt that one of her political
          science professors was heavily favoring the males in the classroom. </p>

        <p>“I literally was raising my hand probably every day, was doing
          everything correctly, like by the book being a participating student,
          ” Zuhse said. “And it was like I wasn’t even there.”</p>

        <p>The second report she filed was about sexual orientation, and Zuhse
          submitted the report on behalf of another student. The third was when
          a professor asked Zhuse what percentage of her blood was “native.”</p>

        <p>Although she says this incident was “very offensive,” she is unaware
          about whether anything came out of the report. </p>

        <p>“I don't even know if they were talked to. I don't know what had
          happened with it,” she said. “And that’s the worst thing, I think,
          about the bias reporting system.”</p>

        <p>But like Elder, Zuhse has given up on the bias reporting system,
          also citing the lack of follow up concerning. </p>

        <p>“You want to know that you're being checked in on. Like you want to
          feel safe, you want to feel like something has been done.
          I never once felt that,” Zuhse said of her bias reporting experiences. </p>

        <h2>The bias reporting system at Elon</h2>
        <p>Elder and Zuhse are not alone. In fact, _______ people filled out
          bias reports at Elon this year. The process is managed by Director of
          Inclusive Community Development Leigh-Anne Royster. </p>

        <p>Anyone who feels like they have experienced an act of bias at Elon
          can file a report online. After filling out as many details as they
          feel necessary, Royster receives the report and determines the
          necessary action moving forward. She strives to follow up with every
          person who files a report, but says this is an area of the system
          that needs improvement.</p>

        <p>1. Outreach – a person fills out a report at elon.edu/u/bias-response/
           to indicate that they experienced bias and would like a response</p>

        <p>2. Understanding - the report is read by Leigh Anne Royster and her
          team to understand the context of the incident and find out any
          additional information</p>
        <p>3. Exploration – the team figures out the best avenue to approach the situation </p>

        <p>4. Outreach – the team checks in with the individual who submitted
          the report (this is a work in progress, that can be indicated in the graphic)</p>

        <p>This year, Royster has noticed an uptick in reports of bias in a
          classroom setting. She says this does not necessarily mean that more
          incidents of bias are happening in classrooms, rather it could also
          mean that people are more apt to report these incidents than ever before. </p>

        <p>“Experience and expertise tells me that we've been having incidents
          of bias in the classroom but that people are feeling more aware or more
          comfortable recording those and speaking out against those,” Royster said. </p>

        <p>The number of hate crimes in the United States has risen steadily over
          the past several years. Between 2016 and 2017 alone, reports of hate crimes
          <span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/13/us/hate-crimes-fbi-2017.html">
            jumped by 17% </a></span> and three out of five hate crimes in 2017 were
            motivated by race.</p>

        <p>Royster says that Elon may mirror the national trends.</p>

        <p>“Do I think that there is a significant issue with bias or
          discrimination and bigotry and hate, um, particularly in the
          United States? Absolutely. And I think that Elon is a microcosm of
          that,” Royster said.</p>

        <p>While new faculty and staff members at Elon are required to participate
          in Title IX, or gender discrimination training, bias training is not
          mandatory. Royster calls this a “strategic decision,” as she says the
          training sessions currently attract those who are most interested in
          understanding how to better address these incidents. </p>

        <p>“It does seem as if we do a good job of messaging… about the importance
          of diversity and inclusion throughout the work,” she said.
          “It’s just not mandatory.”</p>
      <div id="advocates">
        <h2>Advocates and resources</h2>
        <p>One resource for people who have filled out a bias report and are
          looking for additional support are process advocates, faculty members
          who volunteer to help individuals through the bias report system.</p>

        <p>The ten current process advocates receive specialized trainings in
          dealing with trauma, active listening and other related skills.
          Royster says it’s important for anyone who has experienced bias to be
          able to connect with someone of a similar identity.</p>

        <p>“I don't have the lived experience of being a person of color and
          someone who, you know, experience being targeted in that way,” she said.
          “I’d want to speak with someone who understands the experience of
          being a person of color.” </p>

        <p>Although he is not a process advocate, Assistant Dean of Students
          Tyrone Jean also helps students who have filed a bias report by
          serving as an advocate and providing resources after the report is submitted.</p>

        <p>“The system is really just an opportunity for students to report and
          if they want action, this is the sort of the formal mechanism in which
          they can sort of seek that action,” Jean said. </p>

        <p>Jean, who has worked at Elon for two years, has worked with nine
          students so far. He says that many students may not know that the bias
          reporting system even exists.</p>

        <p>“There needs to be some way where students hear about it in the
          residence halls, in the classroom at orientation, and as a part of their
          student organizations,” he said.  “The messaging around it needs to be
          consistent, and it needs to expand for years.”</p>

        <p>Jean is also the director of Elon’s Center for Race, Ethnicity and Diversity
          Education (CREDE). He hopes that students see the CREDE as a resource,
          especially when they have experienced an act of bias. While he says the
          CREDE cannot advocate for individual students, its employees can help
          guide individuals through the bias reporting process.</p>

        <p>“We’re not trying to take sides, but we can also be a voice for
          students and amplify their voice,” he said.</p>

        <p>When Elder filed a bias report, she says Jean reached out to her to
          offer his support. “We talked about it because he wanted to make sure
          I was okay and everything,” she said. “But I never really got
          anything further than that.”</p>
      </div>
      <div id="improvement">
        <h2>Room for improvement</h2>
        <p>While Zuhse, Elder, Royster and Jean each approach the bias reporting
          system through their own unique lens, they all agree that there are
          several ways in which the process can be further developed.</p>

        <p>Zuhse says that while the school attempts to be inclusive, its
          approach could be improved.</p>

        <p>“I think Elon does inclusion by immersion and you just throw people
          in and think they're going to be diverse and welcoming,” she said.
          “And that's not the case at all.”</p>

        <p>She also says that faculty could be trained better to handle situations
          that are especially prone to bias.</p>

        <p>“For a university that prides itself on being inclusive and diverse,
          a small number of our faculty members actually have the tools to deal
          with diverse students,” Zuhse said.</p>

        <p>According to Royster, the Center for Advancement regularly hosts optional
          diversity trainings for faculty and staff at “key times” throughout the year.</p>

        <p>Zuhse also believes that students should be better informed about the bias
          reporting system to begin with, and that the education should come from faculty.
          She said she “lucked out” by having a professor during her freshman year who
          explained bias reports to her class, but she knows many of her peers did not
          have the same experience. </p>

        <p>“I'm really glad that that happened, but I don't think that that's the
          case for a lot of students on Elon's campus,” she said.</p>

        <p>Elder sees bias reports as a road to education for anyone who
          commits an act of bias.</p>

        <p>“I think we have great opportunities for teaching moments,” she said.
          “If we're creating globally engaged citizens and mindful, thoughtful
          thinkers, then we need to back that up. And I don't think we are right now.”</p>

        <p>Elder noted that the CREDE hosts regular bias and diversity trainings.
          She says trainings like these can be seen as a way for a perpetrator of
          bias to actively engage in the community and reflect on their own actions. </p>

        <p>Both Elder and Zuhse were upset by the fact that they did not receive
          follow up about any of the reports they filed. Royster agrees that this
          is one area she hopes to improve in the future.</p>

        <p>However, Royster also notes that many students indicate on the bias
          report form that they wish to remain anonymous, and therefore cannot
          receive any form of communication from Royster or her colleagues.</p>

        <p>Royster says that as people become more aware of the bias reporting
          system, her team will need to develop new resources and strategies for
          making the system as effective as possible.</p>

        <p>“It is probably a useful time for Elon to turn our attention to
          deepening those engagements… but we need to figure out how to translate
          the deep commitment into meaningful experience.”</p>
