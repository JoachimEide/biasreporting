            <h2>Student Experiences</h2>
            <p>
              Earlier this year, Elon Senior Brianna Elder was scrolling through
              her Instagram feed when she came across a post that surprised her.
              The post, made by another Elon student, made fun of undocumented
              immigrants.
            </p>

            <p>
              She said the student, who Elder chose not to name, often posted
              captions that were “inappropriate,” but felt that one post in
              particular targeted several communities on Elon’s campus and
              needed to be addressed.
            </p>

              “I felt that I was uncomfortable and it was kind of something that
              was like going around. Like my friends had all seen it and nobody
              was really taking action”

            <p>
              This led her to fill out a bias report, a process at Elon and more
              than 200 other colleges and universities in the United States
              where anyone who experiences an act of bias can alert the
              appropriate administrators.
            </p>

            <p>
              The post she reported has since been taken down and the student’s
              account has been made private.
            </p>

            <p>
              After filing the report, Elder had several conversations with
              faculty members who made sure she was feeling okay, but she says
              she never received any follow up about the incident.
            </p>

            <p>
              Elder says she understands that specific details may not be
              public, but she “never really found out what became of it… that
              this was taken care of or that the student has been talked to at
              least.”
            </p>

            <p>
              Since filling out that initial report, Elder has experienced other
              acts of bias but ultimately decided not to file another report
              because she is unsure about the effectiveness of it.
            </p>

            <p>
              Senior Nic Zuhse is also no stranger to the bias report system,
              having filled out three during her time at Elon.
            </p>

            <p>
              All three incidents of bias took place in the classroom. The first
              was gender based. Zuhse felt that one of her political science professors was heavily favoring the males in the classroom.

              “I literally was raising my hand probably every day, was doing
              everything correctly, like by the book being a participating

              The second report she filed was about sexual orientation, and
              Zuhse submitted the report on behalf of another student. The third
              was when a professor asked Zhuse what percentage of her blood was
              “native.”
            </p>

            <p>
              Although she says this incident was “very offensive,” she is
              unaware about whether anything came out of the report.

              But like Elder, Zuhse has given up on the bias reporting system,
              also citing the lack of follow up concerning.

            <p>
              “You want to know that you're being checked in on. Like you want

              never once felt that,” Zuhse said of her bias reporting

            <p>
              The process is managed by Director of Inclusive Community Development
              Leigh-Anne Royster. Anyone who feels like they have experienced an act
              of bias at Elon can file a report online. After filling out as many
              details as they feel necessary, Royster receives the report and
              determines the necessary action moving forward. She strives to follow
              up with every person who files a report, but says this is an area of
              the system that needs improvement.

              1. Outreach – a person fills out a report at
              elon.edu/u/bias-response/ to indicate that they experienced bias
              and would like a response

              2. Understanding - the report is read by Leigh Anne Royster and
              her team to understand the context of the incident and find out
              any additional information
            </p>

            </p>

            <p>
              4. Outreach – the team checks in with the individual who submitted

              the graphic)
            </p>

            <p>
              This year, Royster has noticed an uptick in reports of bias in a
              classroom setting. She says this does not necessarily mean that
              more incidents of bias are happening in classrooms, rather it
              could also mean that people are more apt to report these incidents
              than ever before.
            </p>

            <p>
              “Experience and expertise tells me that we've been having
              incidents of bias in the classroom but that people are feeling
              more aware or more comfortable recording those and speaking out
              against those,” Royster said.
            </p>

              The number of hate crimes in the United States has risen steadily
              over the past several years. Between 2016 and 2017 alone, reports
              of hate crimes

                  jumped by 17%
                </a></span>
              and three out of five hate crimes in 2017 were motivated by race.
            </p>

            <object data="pictures/ex-graph2.svg" type="image/svg+xml"></object>


            <p>Royster says that Elon may mirror the national trends.</p>

            <p>
              “Do I think that there is a significant issue with bias or
              discrimination and bigotry and hate, um, particularly in the
              United States? Absolutely. And I think that Elon is a microcosm of
              that,” Royster said.
            </p>

            <p>
              While new faculty and staff members at Elon are required to
              participate in Title IX, or gender discrimination training, bias
              training is not mandatory. Royster calls this a “strategic
              decision,” as she says the training sessions currently attract
              those who are most interested in understanding how to better
              address these incidents.
            </p>

            <p>
              “It does seem as if we do a good job of messaging… about the
              importance of diversity and inclusion throughout the work,” she
              said. “It’s just not mandatory.”

                One resource for people who have filled out a bias report and
                are looking for additional support are process advocates,
                faculty members who volunteer to help individuals through the
                bias report system.
              </p>

              <p>
                The ten current process advocates receive specialized trainings
                in dealing with trauma, active listening and other related
                skills. Royster says it’s important for anyone who has
                experienced bias to be able to connect with someone of a similar
                identity.
              </p>

                “I don't have the lived experience of being a person of color
                and someone who, you know, experience being targeted in that
                way,” she said.

                Although he is not a process advocate, Assistant Dean of
                Students Tyrone Jean also helps students who have filed a bias
                report by serving as an advocate and providing resources after
                the report is submitted.
              </p>

              <p>
                “The system is really just an opportunity for students to report
                and if they want action, this is the sort of the formal
                mechanism in which they can sort of seek that action,” Jean
                said.
              </p>

              <p>
                Jean, who has worked at Elon for two years, has worked with nine
                students so far. He says that many students may not know that
                the bias reporting system even exists.
              </p>

              <p>
                “There needs to be some way where students hear about it in the
                residence halls, in the classroom at orientation, and as a part
                of their student organizations,” he said. “The messaging around
                it needs to be consistent, and it needs to expand for years.”
              </p>

              <p>
                Jean is also the director of Elon’s Center for Race, Ethnicity
                and Diversity Education (CREDE). He hopes that students see the
                CREDE as a resource, especially when they have experienced an
                act of bias. While he says the CREDE cannot advocate for
                individual students, its employees can help guide individuals
                through the bias reporting process.
              </p>

              <p>
                “We’re not trying to take sides, but we can also be a voice for
                students and amplify their voice,” he said.
              </p>

              <p>
                When Elder filed a bias report, she says Jean reached out to her
                to offer his support. “We talked about it because he wanted to
                make sure I was okay and everything,” she said. “But I never
                really got anything further than that.”

                reporting system through their own unique lens, they all agree

                Zuhse also believes that students should be better informed
                about the bias reporting system to begin with, and that the
                education should come from faculty. She said she “lucked out” by
                having a professor during her freshman year who explained bias
                reports to her class, but she knows many of her peers did not
                have the same experience.

                that's the case for a lot of students on Elon's campus,” she
                said.

                Elder sees bias reports as a road to education for anyone who
                commits an act of bias.

                “I think we have great opportunities for teaching moments,” she
                said.

                Elder noted that the CREDE hosts regular bias and diversity
                trainings. She says trainings like these can be seen as a way
                for a perpetrator of bias to actively engage in the community
                and reflect on their own actions.

                Both Elder and Zuhse were upset by the fact that they did not
                receive follow up about any of the reports they filed. Royster
                agrees that this is one area she hopes to improve in the future.
              </p>

              <p>
                However, Royster also notes that many students indicate on the
                bias report form that they wish to remain anonymous, and
                therefore cannot receive any form of communication from Royster
                or her colleagues.
              </p>

              <p>
                Royster says that as people become more aware of the bias
                reporting system, her team will need to develop new resources
                and strategies for making the system as effective as possible.

                “It is probably a useful time for Elon to turn our attention to
                deepening those engagements… but we need to figure out how to
                translate the deep commitment into meaningful experience.”
