00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.800
I don't even know if they were 
talked to, I don't know what had
2
00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:05.120
happened with it, and that is the 
worst thing I think about the
3
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.120
biasreportingsystem is it's almost 
like if you go to the police and
4
00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.120
you report something.
You want to know that you are

5
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.120
being checked on, you want to
feel safe, you want to feel like

6
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:21.120
something has been done. I never 
once felt that, until this past

7
00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.000
year when I heard that the bias 
reportingsystem had changed.
