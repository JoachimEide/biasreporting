00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:04.110
I don't even know if they were
talked to, I don't know what had

2
00:00:04.111 --> 00:00:06.120
happened with it, and that is the
worst thing I think about the

3
00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:10.120
biasreportingsystem is it's almost
like if you go to the police and

4
00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.110
you report something.
You want to know that you are

5
00:00:13.111 --> 00:00:16.000
being checked on, you want to
feel safe, you want to feel like

6
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:22.360
something has been done. I never
once felt that, until this past

7
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.360
year when I heard that the bias
reportingsystem had changed.
