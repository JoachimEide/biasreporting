            <h2>Student Experiences</h2>
            <p>
              Earlier this year, Elon Senior Brianna Elder was scrolling through
              her Instagram feed when she came across a post that surprised her.
              The post, made by another Elon student, made fun of undocumented
              immigrants.
            </p>

            <p>
              She said the student, who Elder chose not to name, often posted
              captions that were “inappropriate,” but felt that one post in
              particular targeted several communities on Elon’s campus and
              needed to be addressed.
            </p>

              “I felt that I was uncomfortable and it was kind of something that
              was like going around. Like my friends had all seen it and nobody
              was really taking action”

            <p>
              This led her to fill out a bias report, a process at Elon and more
              than 200 other colleges and universities in the United States
              where anyone who experiences an act of bias can alert the administrators.
            </p>

            <p>
              The post she reported has since been taken down and the student’s
              account has been made private.
            </p>

            <p>
              After filing the report, Elder had several conversations with
              faculty members who made sure she was feeling OK, but she says
              she never received any follow up about the incident specifically.
            </p>

            <p>
              “I never really found out what became of it… that this was taken
              care of or that the student has been talked to at least,” she said.
            </p>

            <p>
              Since filling out that initial report, Elder has experienced other
              acts of bias but ultimately decided not to file another report because
              she is unsure about the effectiveness of it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Anyone who feels like they have experienced an act of bias at Elon
              can file a report <span><a href="https://www.elon.edu/u/bias-response/">online.</a></span> After filling out as many details as they
              feel necessary,  Director of Inclusive Community Development Leigh-Anne Royster
              receives the report and determines the necessary actions moving forward. She
              strives to follow up with every person who files a report, but says this is
              an area of the system that needs improvement.
            </p>

            <p>
              Senior Nic Zuhse felt the same way as Elder, having filled out
              three bias reports during her time at Elon.
            </p>

            <p>
              All three incidents of bias took place in the classroom. The first
              was gender based. Zuhse felt that one of her political science professors
              was heavily favoring the males in the classroom.
            </p>

            <p id="hand">
              “I literally was raising my hand probably every day, was doing everything
              correctly, like by the book being a participating student,” Zuhse said.
              “And it was like I wasn’t even there.”
            </p>
            <div class="line">

            <div class="padding">

            <p>
              The second report she filed was about sexual orientation, and Zuhse
              submitted the report on behalf of another student. The third was when a
              professor asked Zhuse what percentage of her blood was “native.”
            </p>

            <p>
              Although she says this incident was “very offensive,” she is
              unaware about whether anything came out of the report. She says she did
              not receive follow up from university administrators.

            <p>
              Like Elder, Zuhse gave up on the bias reporting system, citing
              concerns for the lack of follow up.
            </p>

            <p>
              “You want to know that you're being checked in on. Like you want to
              feel safe, you want to feel like something has been done. I never once
              felt that,” Zuhse said of her bias reporting experiences. No one followed
              up with her after she submitted bias reports, even when they were not anonymous.

            <p>
              Elder and Zuhse are not alone. In fact, an average of 40 bias reports
              are filed at Elon each semester according to Royster, who manages the
              bias report system at Elon.

            <p>
              This year, Royster has noticed an increase in reports of bias in a
              classroom setting. She says this does not necessarily mean that more
              incidents of bias are happening in classrooms, rather it could also mean
              that people are more apt to report these incidents than ever before.

              “Experience and expertise tells me that we've been having
              incidents of bias in the classroom but that people are feeling
              more aware or more comfortable recording those and speaking out
              against those,” Royster said.
            </p>
            <p>
              Royster did not provide data about specific trends, but said that
              gender and race are consistently the categories with the most bias
              reports. Over the last nine semesters, she said gender bias has been
              the most reported category overall.
            </p>

            <p>
              The number of hate crimes in the United States has risen steadily
              over the past several years. Between 2016 and 2017 alone, reports of
              hate crimes jumped by 17% and three out of five hate crimes in 2017 were
              motivated by race.
            </p>

            <!-- GRAPH 2 HER-->


            <p>Royster also said that Elon may mirror national trends.</p>

            <p>
              “Do I think that there is a significant issue with bias or discrimination
              and bigotry and hate particularly in the United States? Absolutely. And
              I think that Elon is a microcosm of that,” Royster said.
            </p>

            <p>
              While new faculty and staff members at Elon are required to participate in Title
              IX, or gender discrimination training, bias training is not mandatory.
              Royster called this a “strategic decision,” as she says the training
              sessions currently attract those who are most interested in understanding
              how to better address these incidents.
            </p>

            <p>
              “It does seem as if we do a good job of messaging… about the
              importance of diversity and inclusion throughout the work,” she said.
              “It’s just not mandatory.”

              <p>
                One resource for people who have filled out a bias report and are
                looking for additional support is a process advocate, a faculty member
                who volunteers to help individuals through the bias report system.
              </p>

              <p>
                The 10 current process advocates receive specialized trainings in
                dealing with trauma, active listening and other related skills.
                Royster says it’s important for anyone who has experienced bias to be
                able to connect with someone of a similar identity.
              </p>

              <p>
                “I don't have the lived experience of being a person of color and
                someone who, you know, experiences being targeted in that way,” she said.
                For instance, she added, a person of color who submits a bias report may
                “want to speak with someone who understands the experience of being a person of color.”
              </p>


              <p>
                Although he is not a process advocate, Assistant Dean of
                Students Tyrone Jean also helps students who have filed a bias
                report by serving as an advocate and providing resources after
                the report is submitted.

                “The system is really just an opportunity for students to report

                Jean, who has worked at Elon for two years, has worked with nine
                students so far. He says that many students may not know that the
                bias reporting system even exists.
              </p>

              <p>
                “There needs to be some way where students hear about it in the
                residence halls, in the classroom at orientation, and as a part of
                their student organizations,” he said.  “The messaging around it needs
                to be consistent, and it needs to expand for years.”

                Jean is also the director of Elon’s Center for Race, Ethnicity and
                Diversity Education (CREDE). He hopes that students see the CREDE
                as a resource, especially when they have experienced an act of bias.
                While he says the CREDE does not advocate for individual students, its
                employees can help guide individuals through the bias reporting process.

                “We’re not trying to take sides, but we can also be a voice

                When Elder filed a bias report, she says Jean reached out to her
                to offer his support. “We talked about it because he wanted to
                make sure I was OK and everything,” she said. “But I never really

                She also says that faculty could be trained better to handle
                situations that are especially prone to bias.

                “For a university that prides itself on being inclusive and
                diverse, a small number of our faculty members actually have the
                tools to deal with diverse students,” Zuhse said.

                According to Royster, the Center for Advancement regularly hosts
                optional diversity trainings for faculty and staff at “key times”
                throughout the year.
              </p>

              <p>
                Zuhse also believes that students should be better informed about
                the bias reporting system to begin with, and that the education
                should come from faculty. She said she “lucked out” by having a
                professor during her freshman year who explained bias reports to
                her class, but she knows many of her peers did not have the same experience.
              </p>

              <p>
                “I'm really glad that that happened, but I don't think that
                that's the case for a lot of students on Elon's campus,” she
                said.
              </p>

                Elder sees bias reports as a road to education for anyone who
                commits an act of bias.
              </p>

              <p>
                “I think we have great opportunities for teaching moments,” she
                said.

                Elder noted that the CREDE hosts regular bias and diversity trainings.
                She says trainings like these can be seen as a way for a perpetrator of
                bias to actively engage in the community and reflect on their own actions.
              </p>

              <p>
                Both Elder and Zuhse were upset by the fact that they did not receive specific
                follow up about any of the reports they filed. Royster agreed that this is one
                area she hopes to improve in the future.
              </p>

              <p>
                “Once there is a resolution, following up with folks in determining how
                are you feeling now six months out or how are you,” Royster said.
                “Honestly we were just resource short in terms of being able to do
                that right now, but I would like to improve that in the future.”
              </p>

              <p>
                While Royster would like to follow up with filers more regularly, she
                also noted that many people indicate on the bias report form that they
                wish to remain anonymous. When this is the case, Royster’s office cannot
                communicate with the filer at all.
              </p>

              <p>“Folks think that nothing's happening when it really is more related
                to either they said that they didn't want to be followed up with or that
                there are things that we can't share about the outcomes of the process,” she said.</p>

              <p>Royster says that as people become more aware of the bias reporting system,
                her team will need to develop new resources and strategies for making the system
                as effective as possible.</p>

              <p>
                “It is probably a useful time for Elon to turn our attention to deepening
                those engagements… but we need to figure out how to translate the deep
                commitment into meaningful experience.”
